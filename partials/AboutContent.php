									 <p class="textLevelThree">

										As far back as the 10th century Islamic society, elementary schools (makateb) were attached to the mosques and were part of the social life, where students came to learn the fundamentals of their societal values and beliefs. 11th Century, Muslim Philosopher,Ibn - e - Sina, citing the value of emulation among pupils and the usefulness of group discussions and debates, wrote that children can learn better if taught in classes instead of individual tuition from private tutors.Around a millennium later, after the destruction of the World War II.Loris Malaguzzi and the parents of the villages around Reggio Emilia in Italy, reached the same conclusion that it is in the early years of development when children are forming who they are as an individual. This led to creation of a program based on the principles of respect, responsibility, and community through exploration and discovery in a supportive and enriching environment based on the interests of the children through a self-guided curriculum.

										Today, these views have, in fact, been upheld by scientific evidence. Evidence suggests that the experiences, environment and opportunities provided to a child determine his/her strengths and weaknesses. If a child's world is chaotic, stressful emotionally,cognitively impoverished their potentials will remain undiscovered. On the contrary, if a child's world is safe, nurturing and rich in social, emotional and cognitive opportunities, he/she will flourish.The Bridges School, imparts developmentally appropriate academically competitive, brain - based curriculum that fosters physical, emotional, social creative and cognitive development. Thus our pedagogy not only combines the wisdom of early Islamic scholarship (with strands of Reggio Emilia Approach), it also follows the curriculum guidelines of the NAEYC (National Association for the Education of Young Children â€“a US based organization promoting excellence in children's education.
