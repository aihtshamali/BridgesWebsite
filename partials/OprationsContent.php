									after which the child will be allowed.Absenteeism:We encourage and appreciate children attending classes regularly, so they can benefit from our academic program. <br/>

									Please avoid excessive absentees or late arrivals.We would appreciate a phone call by 9 a.m. when your child is absent due to illness. If your child is absent for two consecutive days, and we haven't heard from the parents/ guardian, the school will call home to inquire about the child. Late Pick-up Policy:Please make arrangements to have your child picked up promptly.Especially for the very young kids, it can be very upsetting to be â€œleft behindâ€ at school, with all the other students having gone home. To provide security and professional child-care, the Preschool will charge a fee of Rs.50/- for each additional half hour that your child remains on campus. This amount will be billed to your child's next bill. Snacks and Lunches: Snacks and lunches are not provided by the school. As we try to encourage good nutrition, please do not pack candy excessive treats, or caffeine drinks. Please have lunch boxes or bags clearly labeled.Occasionally, with school activities, the school serves small snacks and drinks. If your child has special dietary requirements, please fill out a "Special Instruction Form" so that the school can cater for your child appropriately. Clothing: Comfortable play clothes are most suitable for preschool.Clothing should be easy for children to manage as this increases.
