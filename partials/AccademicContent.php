										TBS carefully considers all aspects of a child's development: emotional, social, physical, as well as cognitive. The Bridges School believes that children can best acquire appropriate knowledge and the needed skills for future learning through a classroom instruction that is complemented by weekly participation in a variety of special subject areas including physical education, music, art, computer, library, & sciences. Thus our curriculum is developmentally appropriate (building upon itself year by year), and is carefully planned,whereby objectives are clearly defined and classroom procedures are sufficiently flexible to allow for attention to variations in developmental levels and for small group instruction.It's an outcome of ongoing conversations among faculty, administration, parents and the student body.

										At TBS, academic growth intertwines with positive social and emotional development.Students from Playgroup through Grade School learn to negotiate and solve conflicts and follow an unwritten contract for living and working together.This sense of community is constantly reinforced through weekly assemblies,rules basedon Islamic and universal human values and through simple techniques like the use of "circle time" that fosters a sense of community by having each student feel recognized and valued, and develop his/her own interpersonal skills and respect for others' points of view.

										The TBS curriculumbuilds upon the experiences from our lower school program, continuing to immerse the student in a language rich environment, while focusing on the building of phonic skills. The phonetic components of language are taught in an integrated approach involving the use of key words and pictures to represent sounds. The children see the words, say the words, andcwrite them. They also build a list of sight words in their word books, accumulating word cards and practicing their use.In literacy work, the children learn about the history of language and other languages such as sign language and pictographs. They study the alphabet and the formation of letters.

They enthusiastically contribute items to fill the beloved "sound box," a container with drawers for each initial consonant. Though early fluency in reading may not seem to be connected to phonic skills, these connections become clear as one sees fluent readers tackle new words.

										Solving problems is an important part of our students' work in math. Math skills are built earlier on as children work with a variety of math manipulatives, including pattern blocks, cubes, geoboards, scales and "teddy bear" counters. They also use a number line to count and mark the days on the calendar. Songs that involve counting and cooking projects encourage children to explore a variety of measurement techniques. They also observe patterns and sequences, and sort and classify objects.The Kindergarteners count the number of days they have attended school, bundle number sticks into tens, and celebrate "Hundred's Day" on their hundredth day of attendance. They also collect data as they survey and graph such things as their birthdays and their means of getting to school.
