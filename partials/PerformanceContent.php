										By providing a safe and structured learning environment, more time in school, and passionate, committed teachers, Bridgeshas helped students make significant academic gains that are closelymonitored through achievement results.Beginning in Nursery,we track student performance across time anduse a variety of observations and tools to gather data and gauge student achievement.These include classroom observations and tests, evaluations of students'skills against international standards allowing TBS to compare the performance of our students to their grade-level peers across the world.While the TBS curriculum is carefully planned, objectives are clearly defined and classroom proceduresare sufficiently flexible to allow for attention to variations in developmental levels and for small group instruction.We,nevertheless, encourage TBS parents to visit the school, talk to the teachers and stay engaged as we support each student, individually, to form good work habits and to becomeachievers, earlier on in their lives.
